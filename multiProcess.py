# IMPORTANT NOTES #
###################

# The child is not notified of the death of its parent, ***it only works the other way***.
# However, when a process dies all its file descriptors are closed. And the other end of a pipe is notified about this,
# if it selects it for reading.

# So your parent can create a pipe before spawning the process (or in fact, you can just set up stdin to be a pipe),
# and the child can select that for reading. It will report ready for reading when the parent end is closed. 
# This requires your child to run a mail loop, or at least make regular calls to select. 
# If you don't want that, you'll need some manager process to do it, but then when that one is killed, things break again.
