# magi_parallel
building code to parallelize magi

1. Write simple multiprocess program - Learning

2. Write simple multithreaded program - Learning

3. Kill thread vs. Kill process

4. Compare performance over extended programs (continuous running for some cycles) - Testing

5. From previous results, start magi.
